Adapter pattern is used when we want to add new responsobilities to object.
GoF defenition - it converts the interface of a class into another interface that client expect.
The adapter pattern lets classes work together that could not otherwice beacouse of incompatible
interfaces.

Types of adapters:
- object adapter - adapt through object composition, it holds the adaptee instance.
- class adapter - adapt through subclassing and supports multiple inheritance.
But java dont support multiple inheritance.
